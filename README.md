# JioHotstar System Design

## Overview
JioHotstar is a high-performance video streaming platform providing users with access to a vast catalog of movies, TV shows, live sports, and original content. The platform supports millions of concurrent users, demands seamless video streaming, handles large-scale user management, and guarantees a smooth user experience across multiple devices.

The goal of this design is to build a scalable, resilient, and secure architecture that supports a global user base while ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.

## Core Features
1. **Multi-Device Streaming**: Support for smartphones, smart TVs, laptops, and web browsers.
2. **Content Library**: Movies, TV shows, live sports events, and original programming.
3. **Live Streaming**: Live sports events with low-latency streaming.
4. **Subscription Plans**: Tiered subscription models for free, premium, and exclusive content.
5. **User Preferences**: Personalized recommendations based on user behavior and preferences.
6. **Multi-language Support**: Support for different languages and regional content.
7. **Offline Viewing**: Allows users to download content for offline viewing.

## Key Components of the System

### 1. User Management
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure login using OAuth 2.0 or JWT tokens for Single Sign-On (SSO). Users can sign in using Jio or Hotstar credentials. This also supports third-party authentication (Google, Facebook, etc.).
- **User Profiles**: Stores preferences, subscriptions, watch history, and user settings. Profile information is critical for personalized recommendations and subscriptions.
- **Session Management**: Each userâ€™s session is stored and managed using a distributed session store (e.g., Redis) to ensure sessions are available across multiple devices.

**Tech Stack:**
- Authentication: OAuth 2.0, JWT
- Databases: MongoDB, MySQL
## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling:
- **Web Servers**: Scale horizontally to handle an increasing number of concurrent user requests. Use load balancers to distribute requests evenly across multiple application instances.
- **Streaming Servers**: Streaming servers can also be scaled horizontally to support high-demand live events or popular on-demand videos.

### Database Scaling:
- **Sharding**: User data and content metadata can be sharded across multiple database instances. This ensures horizontal scaling and improved query performance.
- **Replication**: Implement read replicas to offload read-heavy operations from the primary database.

### CDN and Caching:
- **Global CDN**: Use a CDN to cache video content at edge locations, minimizing latency for users in different regions.
- **Redis**: Use Redis to cache frequently accessed data, such as user sessions, recommendations, and popular content.

### Fault Tolerance:
- **Redundancy**: Implement backup services for critical components like databases and CDN.
- **Auto-scaling**: Automatically scale services up or down based on traffic demands, ensuring optimal resource usage.

## Conclusion
This system design for JioHotstar provides a scalable, resilient, and user-centric architecture capable of handling millions of concurrent users while offering high-quality video streaming. By leveraging modern cloud infrastructure, machine learning for recommendations, and cutting-edge streaming technologies, this platform can provide a seamless experience to users worldwide.

- Cache: Redis

### 2. Content Management
- **Video Storage**: Cloud-based storage such as AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage. Each video is uploaded and stored in multiple formats (MP4, WebM, etc.) to support different devices.
- **Video Metadata**: Metadata (title, description, cast, genre, etc.) is stored in a NoSQL database (MongoDB) for scalability and fast access. Structured content tagging allows easy search and filtering.
- **Content Moderation**: For uploaded user content (if allowed), AI-based moderation can be used to detect inappropriate content.
- **Content Ingestion Pipeline**: Automated pipelines for content encoding, transcoding, and metadata generation using tools like FFmpeg.

**Tech Stack:**
- Storage: AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage
- Transcoding: FFmpeg
- Database: MongoDB, PostgreSQL

### 3. Video Streaming Infrastructure
- **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming**: Content will be encoded in multiple resolutions and bitrates to cater to varying user network conditions. HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) or DASH will be used for delivering adaptive bitrate streams.
- **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: A global CDN (e.g., AWS CloudFront, Akamai) will cache video content at edge locations to reduce latency and improve user experience across regions. CDN minimizes the load on the origin servers.
- **Transcoding**: A dedicated transcoding service ensures that videos are available in multiple resolutions and formats (e.g., 720p, 1080p, 4K). Automated transcoding jobs are triggered during content ingestion.
- **Video Playback**: The front-end players on various devices (mobile app, smart TVs, web) will handle adaptive streaming and seamlessly adjust the video quality based on network conditions.

**Tech Stack:**
- Streaming Protocol: HLS, DASH
- CDN: AWS CloudFront, Akamai
- Video Player: HTML5 Video Player, Video.js
- Transcoding: FFmpeg, AWS Elemental MediaConvert

### 4. Search and Discovery
- **Search Service**: Elasticsearch is used for content search, allowing users to search across movie titles, TV shows, genres, and actors. Advanced features like fuzzy search, filtering, and sorting are implemented.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Machine learning algorithms, including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and reinforcement learning, are used to suggest personalized content. A recommendation engine analyzes user behavior and preferences to recommend shows and movies.
- **Trending Content**: A real-time analytics pipeline tracks trending movies and shows, with aggregated statistics about popularity based on user interactions.

**Tech Stack:**
- Search Engine: Elasticsearch
- Recommendation Engine: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
- Analytics: Apache Kafka, Apache Spark

### 5. Subscription and Payment System
- **Subscription Plans**: JioHotstar offers tiered subscription plans (Free, Premium, Exclusive). Each plan has access to specific content, with paywalls for exclusive content.
- **Payment Gateway**: Integration with payment providers like Stripe or Razorpay for handling user subscriptions. This includes one-time payments, recurring billing, and subscription upgrades.
- **Subscription Access Control**: Using JWT tokens, user access to content is controlled based on their subscription level. Each piece of content has a flag indicating the subscription tier required to view it.

**Tech Stack:**
- Payment Provider: Stripe, Razorpay
- Access Control: OAuth 2.0, JWT

### 6. Live Streaming Infrastructure
- **Low-Latency Streaming**: For live sports or events, low-latency streaming (less than 5 seconds) is required. WebRTC or RTMP protocols are used to achieve this.
- **Real-Time Video Processing**: Real-time event data (e.g., sports scores, live commentary) is integrated into the live stream to enhance the user experience.
- **Buffering and Adaptive Streams**: During live events, buffering strategies ensure smooth playback, while adaptive bitrate streaming adjusts for network conditions.

**Tech Stack:**
- Protocol: WebRTC, RTMP
- Video Processing: AWS MediaLive, Wowza Streaming Engine

### 7. Analytics and Data Processing
- **Real-time Analytics**: Collect data on user behavior (e.g., play/pause events, viewing patterns) using Kafka to process streams of data.
- **Business Intelligence**: Use data lakes to store aggregated business metrics (e.g., user sign-ups, churn rates). Tools like Tableau or Power BI can be used to visualize and analyze the data.
- **A/B Testing**: The system can A/B test new features or user interfaces to optimize user engagement and retention.

**Tech Stack:**
- Data Processing: Apache Kafka, Apache Flink
- BI Tools: Tableau, Power BI
- Data Warehouse: Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery

### 8. Monitoring and Logging
- **Centralized Logging**: Logs from web servers, application services, and video streaming infrastructure are sent to centralized logging systems such as ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Splunk for real-time monitoring.
- **Metrics and Alerts**: Prometheus and Grafana are used to monitor application performance and resource usage. Custom alerts are set up for anomalies such as server downtime or high traffic spikes.

**Tech Stack:**
- Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana
- Logging: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Splunk
